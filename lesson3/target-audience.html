            <h2>My Target Audience</h2>
            <p>One of my main target audiences will be fans of Wanda and her show WandaVision. This is where the 
               town Westview originates from and I think that fans of the show would be interested in visiting 
               my website to learn more about Wanda,Westview, and my spin on the town. If the town of Westview was real then people living
               in the town would be coming to my website to see what's going on in the town and fun events. In addition to this,
               tourists from around the world would visit my site to see what kind of attractions this town has to offer to plan
               a fun vacation getway.
