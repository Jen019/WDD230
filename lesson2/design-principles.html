                <h3>Hicks Law</h3>
                <h4>Amazon Prime</h4>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/b?node=2858778011&ref_=nav_em__aiv_0_2_2_2">Amazon
                    Website</a>
                <img id="amazonWebsite" src="images/amazon-screen-shot.jpg"
                    alt="Screen-shot of Amazon Prime Video's Webpage" width="650" height="750">
                <p>The idea behind Hick's law is that the Web developer creates a website that
                    makes it easier to find things and spend less time making decisions. The goal is that
                    the user is able to make use of the website as soon as possible to achieve the best results.
                    This law is important because the user is most likely to come back when they have fast
                    results on your website and can find and do what they came to your website to do. Amazon's Prime
                    video Webpage on their website achieves this principle because they have grouped all the video's
                    together according to their genre and is easily accessed by clicking on the categories tab. It also
                    makes it quicker to find the video you were watching, so that you can continue watching it without
                    remembering what video you watched yesterday. I also noticed that they have options to view the
                    videos
                    that were just added. This helps the user know what videos Amazon offers.

                <h3>White Space</h3>
                <h4>Deseret Book</h4>
                <a href="https://deseretbook.com/t/books/fiction">Deseret Book Website</a>
                <img id="deseretBookWeb" src="images/deseret-book-screen-shot.jpeg"
                    alt="Screen-shot of Desert Book's Website" width="710" height="883">
                <p>This is a great example of using white space and having a clean design because
                    these web developers make the white space evenly and well balanced. Instead of squeazing
                    the items together and making it harder to read the book title or item they seperate the items
                    with white space. They also make it easier to read and click on the filtered results to only
                    select a certain genre. Another thing that they have done is use white space to separate the
                    show filters and clear filters button to indicate to the user that they perform different functions.
                    It makes it so that the user is less likely to accidentally click on the clear functions button.
                    Overall, white space is important to make the webpage look and feel clean,organized, and
                    professional.

                <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
                <h4>Tubi</h4>
                <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi Website</a>
                <img id="tubiWebsite" src="images/tubi-screen-shot.jpeg" alt="Screen-shot of Tubi's Website" width="710"
                    height="911">
                <p>Visual Hierarchy refers to the principle of making content that is important stand out
                    among other content. Tubi does a great job of doing this because they use visual design to draw
                    the user's eye to the start watching button. Comparedto the other content on the page, they use a
                    different color, makes it bigger than the other buttons, and makes sure that it is one of the first
                    things the user
                    sees on the web page because they want users to watch movies and shows. Another thing that
                    they do is increase the font on the header so that the user immediately reads and sees that Tubi is
                    a free video platform drawing users in to use their service. They also make the register button
                    stand out, so that users know where they can go to sign up. Visual Hierarchy is important because
                    what
                    the user sees indicates a message to the user of the purpose of your website and values of the
                    company,business, or organization. If the user doesn't like what they see, they might go to another
                    company or business for the service they need which can hurt companies, businesses, and
                    organizations.
